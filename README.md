### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I am Jacob.  I am an aspiring web developer who has been coding for about 1 year. 

Languages that I've used:

â€¢ Javascript
â€¢ Python

Libraries that I've worked with:

â€¢React.js
â€¢Node/Express
â€¢Next.js
â€¢CSS, Less, SASS

I find coding to be very hard but i work very hard at it to learn a little bit each day.  I plan to look for work as a full-stack web developer.  But I would also really like to work either as a back-end developer or a database administrator.
